# SlimeKit
üíö Not the monster you think. Just a better Slim.

SlimeKit is a lightweight enhancement of the Slim Framework that brings modern architectural structure to your PHP applications.
Built for developers who love Slim‚Äôs simplicity and performance‚Äîbut want a cleaner, more scalable project structure.

With a modular approach ‚Äîcovering routes, controllers, services, validators, and helpers‚Äî SlimeKit helps you stay focused on building features without getting lost in messy folders.

Slim Framework + Clear Structure + Developer Happiness = SlimeKit üöÄ

----

Based on [Slim Framework 4](https://www.slimframework.com/docs/v4/) and [Doctrine DBAL](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/dbal.html) for Query Builder

‚úÖ **Requirements**
- PHP v8.2
- PostgreSQL/MySQL (Use [Aiven](https://aiven.io) or [Supabase](https://supabase.com) for free RDBMS Cloud)
- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) account (for Free Image & Video Storage)
- [Mailjet](https://mailjet.com) account (for Free Email SMTP)
- Docker (Optional)

‚öôÔ∏è **Installation**
- Use `git clone` from this repo.
- Configure your `.env` file.

### üöÄ Using Docker
If you‚Äôre using Docker, there‚Äôs no need to create a `.env` file because it will be automatically generated by Docker in the image. Just configure all the necessary setup in the `Dockerfile.dev` or `Dockerfile.prod` and `docker-compose.yml` files.

To get started, simply run the following command in the terminal:
```
docker-compose up
```

If you want to stop:
```
ctrl+c
docker-compose down
```

The application URL is located at `http://localhost:8080/`

### üßë‚Äçüíª Using XAMPP or Laragon
Just configure the `BASE_PATH` section in the `.env` file to point to the path in your local htdocs. For example, if the folder location in XAMPP is `/htdocs/local/slimekit/api`, then set it as shown below:
```
BASE_PATH=/local/slimekit/api
```

### üóÉÔ∏è Environment Variable Configuration
Create a `.env` file to store credential configurations if you use XAMPP or Laragon. But if you use Docker try to setup on `Dockerfile.dev` or `Dockerfile.prod`
```
ENVIRONMENT=DEVELOPMENT
BASE_PATH=/local/race/api
APP_NAME=SlimeKit

# SYM KEY (FILL WITH ALPHANUMERIC STRING)
SYM_KEY=

# DATABASE SECTION
DB_HOST=
DB_PORT=
DB_USER=
DB_PASS=
DB_NAME=
DB_CLIENT=pgsql/mysql

# CLOUDINARY SECTION
CLOUDINARY_URL=

# MAILJET SECTION
SMTP_HOST=
SMTP_USER=
SMTP_PASS=
SMTP_PORT=
MAIL_FROM=
MAIL_FROM_NAME="Slimekit"
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Install Dependency
```
composer install
```
or force using
```
composer update --ignore-platform-reqs
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Adjust Database Migration
```
composer migrate
composer migrate:generate
```
- Use `generate` to create a new migration.
- Use `rollback` if you only want to step back one version.
- Use `migrate prev` to revert to the previous version.
- Use `migrate <version>` to roll back to a specific version.
- Use `migrate 0` to remove all migrations.

### ü™Ñ Create Module
To generate file in Controller, Service, and Validator:
```
composer make:module NamaModule
composer make:module:admin NamaModule
composer make:module:client NamaModule
```

### üîÅ Refresh Autoload Namespace
```
composer dump-autoload -o
```
